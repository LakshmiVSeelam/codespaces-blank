    <!-- Story 1: Variables as Characters -->
    <div class="story">
      <h2>Variables as Characters</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time, there was a magical kingdom where characters, like <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong>, played their roles. The hero, <strong>let</strong>, could change as the story progressed, adapting to the challenges ahead. Meanwhile, <strong>const</strong> remained constant, a reliable companion who never changed.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Story 2: Functions as Spells -->
    <div class="story">
      <h2>Functions as Magic Spells</h2>
      <p>In this land, wizards cast spells (functions). Some were written down in books (function declarations), while others were spoken aloud only when needed (function expressions). A special kind of spell, the <strong>arrow function</strong>, allowed wizards to cast quickly and efficiently. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Animation Example: Event Loop -->
    <div class="story">
      <h2>Event Loop in Action</h2>
      <p>Imagine the kingdomâ€™s daily operations, where tasks pile up on a to-do list. Some tasks need to be completed immediately, while others can wait. The royal messenger (event loop) ensures that everything gets done in the right order.</p>
      <div class="animation"></div>
      <p>The blue ball represents tasks being moved from the queue to the stack. It moves back and forth, showing how the event loop handles tasks in order.</p>
